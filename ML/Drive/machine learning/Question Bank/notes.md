Diff between hierarchical clustering and k means
Hierarchical clustering canâ€™t handle big data well but K Means clustering can. This is because the time complexity of K Means is linear i.e. O(n) while that of hierarchical clustering is quadratic i.e. O(n2).
In K Means clustering, since we start with random choice of clusters, the results produced by running the algorithm multiple times might differ. While results are reproducible in Hierarchical clustering.
K Means is found to work well when the shape of the clusters is hyper spherical (like circle in 2D, sphere in 3D).
K Means clustering requires prior knowledge of K i.e. no. of clusters you want to divide your data into. But, you can stop at whatever number of clusters you find appropriate in hierarchical clustering by interpreting the dendrogram
